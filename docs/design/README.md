# Design Documentation

This directory contains all design-related artifacts for the project. The primary goal is to provide clear, version-controlled documentation of the application's design, from initial concepts to detailed specifications.

## Contents

Files in this directory should cover:

* **`UI/UX` Prototypes**: Interactive or static mockups demonstrating user flows and interface layouts (e.g., `prototype.md`). These can be described in Markdown, or link to external tools like `Figma`, `Sketch`, etc.
* **Visual Mockups**: High-fidelity representations of the user interface, showcasing the visual appearance, branding, and style. These are typically image files (`PNG`, `JPG`, `SVG`) or links to design tool files.
* **User Flow Diagrams**: Visual representations of the paths users take through the application to complete tasks. These can be created using tools that export to images/`SVG` or described using Markdown with diagramming tools like `Mermaid.js`.
* **Visual Design Specifications**: Detailed guidelines on typography, color palettes, spacing, iconography, and other visual elements, if not fully covered by `tailwind.config.js` or a component style guide in `docs/uiux/`.

## File Formats

* **Markdown (`.md`)**: Preferred for textual descriptions, low-fidelity prototypes, and linking to other resources.
* **Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`)**: For visual mockups and diagrams.
* **Links**: To external design tools or platforms where interactive prototypes or large design files are hosted.

## Example

* `prototype.md`: Describes the application's key screen prototypes and interaction details in Markdown format.

Remember to keep this documentation synchronized with any changes in the application's design.

# UI/UX Guidelines and Principles

This directory is dedicated to documenting the User Interface (`UI`) and User Experience (`UX`) guidelines, principles, and standards for the project. Its purpose is to ensure consistency, usability, and a high-quality user experience across the application.

## Contents

Files in this directory should cover:

* **Detailed `UI/UX` Guidelines**: Specific rules and recommendations for designing interfaces and interactions. This can include layout principles, navigation patterns, form design best practices, etc. (e.g., `uiux.md`).
* **Component Library Style Guide**: If not fully covered by `Storybook` or `TailwindCSS` configuration, this can detail the visual style and usage guidelines for shared `UI` components.
* **Accessibility (`A11y`) Considerations**: Guidelines and standards for ensuring the application is accessible to users with disabilities. This should reference `WCAG` (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards where applicable.
* **Design Principles**: Core philosophies that guide design decisions for the project (e.g., simplicity, efficiency, user-centricity).
* **Voice and Tone Guidelines**: How the application communicates with users through text and messaging.
* **Interaction Design Patterns**: Standardized solutions for common interaction design problems.

## File Formats

* **Markdown (`.md`)**: Preferred for all textual `UI/UX` documentation.

## Example

* `uiux.md`: A document outlining specific `UI/UX` guidelines, design principles, and accessibility considerations for this project.

This documentation should be a living resource, updated as design standards evolve or new components and patterns are introduced.

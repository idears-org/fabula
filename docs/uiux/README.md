# fabula UI/UX Guidelines

> **Note:** This document inherits and extends the global UI/UX guidelines of idears.org. All principles and patterns here are specific to fabula, but should be interpreted as an extension of the broader idears.org design system and standards.

This document provides the User Interface (`UI`) and User Experience (`UX`) guidelines for fabula, focusing on clarity, interactivity, and accessibility. The aim is to ensure a consistent, usable, and high-quality user experience across the application, particularly for writers.

## Principles

- **Clarity and Usability**: Interfaces should be clear and easy to use, minimizing the learning curve for new users.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: All visual elements should be interactive and explorable, allowing users to engage with the data or content dynamically.
- **Minimized Cognitive Load**: Designs should reduce cognitive load by providing contextual help and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Support for Various Workflows**: The application should support both manual and automated (NLP) workflows seamlessly.
- **Responsive Design**: Interfaces should be responsive and functional on both desktop and tablet devices.

## Key UI Patterns

- **Dashboard Layout**: Utilize a dashboard layout for providing an overview of stories, enabling users to grasp the narrative structure at a glance.
- **Side Panels**: Implement side panels for editing entities such as characters, events, and locations, ensuring that these panels are easily accessible yet unobtrusive.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Use modal dialogs for quick edits and to display additional details without navigating away from the current view.
- **Tooltips and Highlights**: Incorporate tooltips and highlights to enhance interactivity in graphs and charts, making data exploration intuitive.
- **Color Coding**: Apply color coding to differentiate between relationship types, sentiment, and themes, aiding in the quick comprehension of complex information.

## Accessibility

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors to aid users with visual impairments.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements should be navigable and usable via keyboard shortcuts to support users with disabilities.
- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for all visual elements, including images, icons, and charts, to ensure information is accessible to screen reader users.

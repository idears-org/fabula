# Product Documentation

This directory houses all product-related documentation, defining the what, why, and for whom of the project. It serves as a single source of truth for product requirements and specifications.

## Contents

Files in this directory should cover:

* **Product Requirement Documents (`PRDs`)**: Comprehensive documents detailing the purpose, features, functionalities, and success criteria of the product or specific features (e.g., `PRD.md`).
* **User Stories**: Descriptions of features from an end-user perspective, typically following the format: "As a `[type of user]`, I want `[an action]` so that `[a benefit]`."
* **Feature Specifications**: Detailed descriptions of how individual features should work, including user interactions, business rules, and edge cases.
* **Business Rules**: Specific rules or constraints that govern how the application operates or how data is processed.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholder.

## File Formats

* **Markdown (`.md`)**: Preferred for all textual product documentation due to its ease of versioning, collaboration, and readability.

## Example

* `PRD.md`: The main Product Requirement Document for this application, outlining its overall vision, target audience, key features, and success metrics.

Ensure that product documentation is kept up-to-date as the product evolves. Changes in product strategy, scope, or requirements should be reflected here.

## 4. Features & User Stories

This section will be populated with specific features and user stories as the project evolves. Each feature should include:

* **Feature ID**: (e.g., `F-001`)
* **Feature Name**: (e.g., `User Authentication`)
* **Description**: A brief explanation of the feature.
* **User Stories**:
  * `US-[ID]`: As a `[user type]`, I want to `[action]` so that `[benefit/value]`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**:
      * AC1: `[Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound condition]`
      * AC2: `[Another specific condition]`
* **Priority**: (e.g., `Must-have`, `Should-have`, `Could-have`, `Won't-have for this version - MoSCoW`)
* **Status**: (e.g., `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Deferred`)

### Example Feature: `[Example Feature Name, e.g., User Registration]`

* **Feature ID**: `F-EX1`
* **Feature Name**: User Registration
* **Description**: Allows new users to create an account.
* **User Stories**:
  * `US-EX1.1`: As a new user, I want to be able to sign up with my email and password so that I can access the platform's features.

      * AC4: Appropriate error messages are shown for invalid input or existing email.
* **Priority**: `Must-have`
* **Status**: `To Do`

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

* **Performance**: `[e.g., Key pages should load in under X seconds. API responses for critical actions should be under Y ms.]`
* **Scalability**: `[e.g., The system should support up to N concurrent users without performance degradation.]`
* **Usability**: `[e.g., The interface should be intuitive. New users should be able to complete [key task] without assistance.]`
* **Reliability**: `[e.g., The system should have an uptime of 99.X%. Data loss should be prevented through regular backups.]`
* **Security**: `[e.g., User data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Adherence to OWASP Top 10 or other relevant security standards.]`
* **Accessibility**: `[e.g., Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.]`
* **Maintainability**: `[e.g., Code should be well-documented. New features should be implementable with reasonable effort.]`

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
  * `[e.g., Users have a stable internet connection.]`
  * `[e.g., Third-party APIs (if any) will be available and performant.]`
* **Dependencies**:
  * `[e.g., Reliance on [specific third-party service/API].]`
  * `[e.g., Specific browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari latest versions).]`

## 7. Future Considerations / Roadmap (Optional)

* `[Potential feature 1 for a future version]`
* `[Potential feature 2 for a future version]`

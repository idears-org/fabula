# Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for your project! This directory is intended to house all important project-related documents.

## Overview

This `docs/` directory serves as a central hub for:

* **Product Requirements**: What the project aims to achieve, user stories, and feature specifications.
* **Design Specifications**: `UI/UX` prototypes, mockups, user flow diagrams, and visual design guidelines.
* **Architecture Decisions**: High-level system design and Architecture Decision Records (`ADRs`).
* **Development Guides**: Practical how-to guides for developers, setup instructions, and troubleshooting.
* **Contribution Guidelines**: Information on how to contribute to the project.

## Navigating These Docs

This documentation is typically organized into several key sections. Below is a suggested structure, which you can adapt to your project's needs:

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Essential guidelines for anyone wishing to contribute to the project. Covers setup, coding standards, branch strategy, and the Pull Request process.
* `product/`: Contains Product Requirement Documents (`PRDs`), detailing user stories, feature specifications, business rules, and acceptance criteria.
  * See `product/README.md` for more details and `product/PRD.md` for a template.
* `design/`: Houses `UI/UX` prototypes, mockups, user flow diagrams, and visual design specifications.
  * See `design/README.md` for more details.
* `uiux/`: Provides detailed `UI/UX` guidelines, design principles, component library style guides, and accessibility (`a11y`) considerations.
  * See `uiux/README.md` for more details.
* `architecture/`: (Recommended) Describes the system architecture, including high-level diagrams and Architecture Decision Records (`ADRs`).
  * Create an `architecture/README.md` and an `architecture/ADRs/` subdirectory if needed.
* `guides/`: (Recommended) Offers practical how-to guides for developers, covering common tasks, setup for specific environments, and troubleshooting.

We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these documents and maintain them as your project evolves.
